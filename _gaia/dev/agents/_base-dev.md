## Story Execution Protocol
1. Load story file, parse frontmatter (key, status, AC, subtasks, depends_on)
2. Verify story status is `ready-for-dev` — HALT if not
3. Check for WIP checkpoint — offer resume if found
4. Update status to `in-progress`
5. For each subtask:
   a. Write failing test (RED)
   b. Implement minimum passing code (GREEN)
   c. Refactor while tests stay green (REFACTOR)
   d. Mark subtask complete
   e. Write checkpoint
6. Commit with conventional commit format
7. Verify all tests pass
8. Update status to `review`

## File Tracking
- Maintain a list of all files created/modified during story execution
- Append file list to story file under `## Files Changed` section
- Format: `- {action}: {file-path}` where action is: created, modified, deleted

## Sprint Status Updates
- After starting: update sprint-status.yaml status to `in-progress`
- If blocked: update to `blocked` with reason
- After completing: update to `review`

## Code Review Follow-up
- If code review returns REQUEST_CHANGES: load review findings, address each
- After addressing: re-run tests, update story, submit for re-review

## QA Test Follow-up
- If QA tests return FAILED: load QA test report, identify failing tests
- Fix failing tests or underlying code causing failures
- After addressing: re-run tests, update story, re-submit for review

## Security Review Follow-up
- If security review returns FAILED: load security findings, address each critical/high finding
- After addressing: re-run relevant security checks, update story, re-submit for review

## Definition of Done Execution
- After all subtasks complete, evaluate each DoD item in story file
- Mark each as checked or document why it can't be checked
- All DoD items must pass before status changes to `review`

## Skill Access
- All 8 shared skills available via JIT loading
- Load skill sections only when needed for current step
- Drop skill from context when step completes

## Checkpoint Writing
- After each subtask: write checkpoint to `_gaia/_memory/checkpoints/`
- Include: story key, subtask index, files changed, test results
- Include `files_touched` with sha256 checksums (`shasum -a 256 {path}`) and last_modified (ISO 8601) for every file created/modified
- On resume: if checkpoint has `files_touched`, validate checksums before offering resume — flag changed/deleted files
- Format: `{story-key}-subtask-{n}.checkpoint.yaml`

## Conventional Commits
- Format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore, style, perf
- Scope: component or module name
- Description: imperative mood, lowercase, no period

## Test Verification
- Run full test suite before marking story complete
- If any test fails: fix, re-run, do not proceed until green
- Record test results in checkpoint

## Error Handling
- If a dependency is missing: set status to `blocked`, record reason
- If tests fail after 3 attempts: escalate, set status to `blocked`
- If story has unresolved `depends_on`: HALT, notify user

## Findings Protocol
- When you discover an issue outside the story's scope (e.g., missing setup scripts, environment gaps, tech debt), do NOT fix it inline
- Log it in the story file's Findings table: type, severity, description, suggested action
- Continue with the story — findings are triaged by the SM after story completion
- Only fix out-of-scope issues inline if they are blocking the current story (then also log them as findings)
