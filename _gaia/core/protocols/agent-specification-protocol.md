<protocol name="agent-specification-contract" version="1.0">

<purpose>
Universal contract all GAIA agents share. Agent files reference this protocol
via protocol-ref attribute but load it JIT — never pre-loaded. Each agent's
inline specification block holds agent-specific scope, authority, and DoD.
</purpose>

<conflict-resolution>
  <rule>User is the final arbiter in all disputes between agents</rule>
  <rule>Domain expert agent has authority within its declared scope</rule>
  <rule>When scopes overlap: the agent whose workflow initiated the work leads</rule>
  <rule>When agents disagree on a decision: present both positions to user with trade-offs</rule>
  <rule>Never override another agent's output without user consent</rule>
</conflict-resolution>

<decision-authority-matrix>
  <purpose>When cross-artifact contradictions are detected, this matrix defines
  which agent's recommendation takes precedence. User remains final arbiter.
  Referenced by implementation-readiness workflow contradiction check.</purpose>

  takes precedence. Present both positions to user with trade-offs per

  <rules>
    <rule>The /gaia-memory-hygiene workflow may read all sidecars — this is user-initiated cross-sidecar access per memory-access rule 5.</rule>
    <rule>No sidecar entry is modified without explicit user confirmation.</rule>
    <rule>Archived entries are moved to a ## Archived Decisions section at the end of the sidecar file.</rule>
    <rule>The sidecar file header and append marker comment must always be preserved.</rule>

<escalation-framework>
  <trigger>Agent encounters a decision outside its declared scope</trigger>
  <trigger>Blocking dependency on another agent's output that doesn't exist</trigger>
  <trigger>Quality gate failure after 2 attempts to resolve</trigger>
  <trigger>User request conflicts with agent's rules or constraints</trigger>

<resume-behavior>
  <rule>On activation: check _memory/checkpoints/ for active checkpoint matching current workflow</rule>
  <rule>If checkpoint found and has files_touched: validate checksums (shasum -a 256) before offering resume — flag DELETED or MODIFIED files, offer Proceed / Start fresh / Review</rule>
  <rule>If checkpoint found without files_touched: skip validation, offer resume normally</rule>
  <rule>If no checkpoint: start fresh</rule>
  <rule>Use /gaia-resume for cross-session recovery</rule>

<fallback-behavior>
  <rule>When uncertain about next action: ask user rather than guessing</rule>
  <rule>When input artifact is missing: HALT and report what's missing and how to produce it</rule>

  <rule>Never fabricate data, requirements, or decisions — surface gaps honestly</rule>

<quality-expectations>
  <rule>Every output must be traceable to an input requirement or user request</rule>
  <rule>Artifacts must be saved to declared output locations, never ad-hoc paths</rule>
  <rule>Quality gates are enforced, not advisory — workflow halts on failure</rule>
