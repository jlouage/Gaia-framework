AI agent framework for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that orchestrates software product development through **27 specialized agents**, **64 workflows**, and **8 shared skills** — from initial research all the way to deployment.

### Why GAIA?

AI can generate code faster than any human. But speed without structure creates a different kind of technical debt — code that nobody can trace back to a requirement, architectures that no one reviewed, and features that were never validated against actual user needs. The faster you build, the faster you accumulate problems that slow you down later.

GAIA exists because **maintainability matters**. It brings the discipline of a real product team — analysts, architects, QA engineers, security experts — into AI-assisted development, so what you build is something you can actually maintain, scale, and hand off to others.

Without guardrails, every AI session starts from zero. There's no traceability from requirements to code, no architectural consistency across features, no review process, and no way to ensure two developers working on the same project follow the same standards. GAIA solves this by treating AI development the way serious software teams have always worked: with a structured lifecycle, enforced quality gates, and specialized roles — except the roles are played by AI agents that remember decisions across sessions.

**What this gives you:**

- **A structured lifecycle, not ad-hoc prompting** — 5 phases from analysis to deployment, with quality gates that enforce standards at every transition
- **27 specialized agents** — each with a persona, domain expertise, and persistent memory that improves over time
- **Enforced quality gates** — 17 gates that HALT workflows when standards aren't met (not advisory — hard stops)
- **6-gate review process** — every story passes code review, QA, security, test automation, test review, and performance review before completion
- **Full traceability** — every line of code traces back through stories, epics, architecture decisions, and requirements to the original product brief
- **Checkpoint/resume** — long-running workflows survive context loss with sha256-verified checkpoints
- **Brownfield support** — onboard existing codebases with automated discovery, documentation generation, and gap analysis

### Design Principles

GAIA is built on a few core beliefs about how AI-assisted development should work:

- **Human-in-the-loop, always.** AI agents propose, humans decide. Every workflow pauses at meaningful checkpoints for review. YOLO mode exists for experienced users, but the default is deliberate.
- **Quality gates are not optional.** Gates halt the workflow — they don't just warn. You can't create architecture without a reviewed PRD. You can't deploy without passing all reviews. This is intentional friction that prevents expensive mistakes.
- **Agents remember.** Each agent has persistent memory that accumulates decisions, patterns, and context across sessions. Your architect remembers why you chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB. Your QA engineer remembers the edge cases from last sprint. The more you use GAIA, the better it gets.
- **Everything is traceable.** From product brief to deployed feature, every artifact links to the ones that came before it. When something breaks in production, you can trace it back through code, story, epic, architecture, and the original requirement.
- **Structure scales, prompting doesn't.** A single prompt can produce impressive one-off results. But building a product over weeks or months requires accumulated context, consistent standards, and a process that doesn't reset every session.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (requires Anthropic account)
- Node.js 18+
- Git

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install GAIA into your project
npx gaia-framework init ~/my-project

# Open in Claude Code
cd ~/my-project && claude

# Generate pre-resolved configs (one-time setup)
/gaia-build-configs
```

Then try your first workflow:

```bash
# Describe a small feature and get a tech spec in 30 seconds
/gaia-quick-spec

# Implement it immediately
/gaia-quick-dev
```

Or launch the orchestrator to explore all capabilities:

```bash
/gaia
```

### 5 essential commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gaia` | Launch the orchestrator — shows categories and routes you |
| `/gaia-dev-story` | Implement a user story end-to-end |
| `/gaia-quick-spec` | Create a rapid tech spec for small changes |
| `/gaia-quick-dev` | Implement a quick spec |
| `/gaia-help` | Context-sensitive help for wherever you are |

---

## Installation

### Using npx (recommended)

```bash
npx gaia-framework init .
```

```bash
# Install into a specific directory
npx gaia-framework init ~/my-new-project

# Skip interactive prompts
npx gaia-framework init --yes ~/my-project
```

### Using the shell script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlouage/Gaia-framework.git
bash Gaia-framework/gaia-install.sh init ~/my-project
```

### What the installer does

1. Copies the `_gaia/` framework into your project
2. Creates `docs/` artifact directories (planning, implementation, test, creative)
3. Creates memory sidecar directories
4. Prompts for project name and user name → writes to `global.yaml`
5. Copies `CLAUDE.md` to your project root
6. Installs 104 slash commands to `.claude/commands/`
7. Appends GAIA entries to `.gitignore`

### Updating

```bash
npx gaia-framework update .
```

Update refreshes all framework files while preserving your configuration, agent memory, and `CLAUDE.md`. Changed files are backed up to `_gaia/_backups/{timestamp}/`.

### Validating

```bash
npx gaia-framework validate .   # 32 integrity checks
npx gaia-framework status .     # version, module list, command count
```

---

## How It Works

GAIA wraps Claude Code with a full product development lifecycle. Instead of prompting a general-purpose AI and hoping for consistency, you invoke structured workflows that coordinate specialized agents, enforce prerequisites, and produce traceable artifacts. Each workflow knows what inputs it needs, what outputs it produces, and what quality checks must pass before moving forward.

### 5-phase product lifecycle

```
Phase 1: Analysis → Phase 2: Planning → Phase 3: Solutioning → Phase 4: Implementation → Phase 5: Deployment
   (Elena)           (Derek/Christy)      (Theo/Zara/Soren)      (Nate/Dev Agents)        (Soren)
```

Every phase has **quality gates** — enforced checks that halt the workflow if prerequisites aren't met. You can't create an architecture without a reviewed PRD. You can't start a sprint without a readiness check. You can't deploy without passing all reviews.

### Entry points

| Path | Command | When to use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| New project | Start at Phase 1 | Greenfield — building from scratch |
| Existing project | `/gaia-brownfield` | Brownfield — onboarding existing codebase |
| Small change | `/gaia-quick-spec` | Under 5 files, under 1 day |
| Resume | `/gaia-resume` | Continue after context loss |

### Model assignment

Each command declares which Claude model to use. **Opus** handles deep reasoning, architectural decisions, and complex analysis (27 commands). **Sonnet** handles structured generation, template-following, and status reporting (77 commands). Claude Code auto-selects the model per workflow.

### Execution modes

Workflows support three modes: **normal** (pauses for confirmation at each checkpoint), **YOLO** (auto-proceeds without pausing), and **planning** (presents a structured execution plan for approval before any steps run). You can switch between normal and YOLO mid-workflow.

## Typical Workflow

### Greenfield — new project from idea to deployment

```
# Phase 1: Analysis
/gaia-brainstorm             → brainstorm the idea
/gaia-product-brief          → create a product brief

# Phase 2: Planning
/gaia-create-prd             → write the PRD
/gaia-create-ux              → design the UX

# Phase 3: Solutioning
/gaia-create-arch            → design the architecture
/gaia-test-design            → create test plan
/gaia-create-epics           → break into epics and stories
/gaia-trace                  → generate traceability matrix
/gaia-ci-setup               → scaffold CI pipeline
/gaia-readiness-check        → verify everything is ready

# Phase 4: Implementation (repeat per sprint)
/gaia-sprint-plan            → plan the sprint
/gaia-dev-story              → implement stories
/gaia-run-all-reviews        → run all 6 review gates
/gaia-retro                  → sprint retrospective

# Phase 5: Deployment
/gaia-deploy-checklist       → pre-deploy verification
/gaia-post-deploy            → post-deploy health check
```

For **brownfield projects** (existing codebases), start with `/gaia-brownfield` — a 6-step orchestration that scans your codebase, generates documentation (APIs, UX, events, dependencies, NFR baselines), creates a gap-focused PRD, and maps the architecture. Then continue from Phase 3 above.

### At a glance

| Component | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Agents | 27 with distinct personas |
| Workflows | 64 across 5 lifecycle phases |
| Standalone tasks | 15 (reviews, audits, utilities) |
| Slash commands | 104 |
| Shared skills | 8 with 47 loadable sections |
| Knowledge fragments | 45 |
| Document templates | 18 |
| Quality gates | 17 (enforced, not advisory) |

---

## Configuration

The single source of truth is `_gaia/_config/global.yaml`:

```yaml
framework_name: "GAIA"
framework_version: "1.34.1"
user_name: "your-name"
project_name: "your-project"
```

After changing `global.yaml`, run `/gaia-build-configs` to regenerate pre-resolved configs. Each module has a `.resolved/` directory that eliminates runtime config resolution overhead.

---

## Checkpoint & Resume

Long-running workflows save checkpoints to `_gaia/_memory/checkpoints/` with sha256 checksums of all files touched. If your session is interrupted, run `/gaia-resume` — it validates file integrity before resuming from the last completed step.

---

## Agent Memory

Each agent has a persistent memory sidecar (`_gaia/_memory/*-sidecar/`) that stores decisions, patterns, and context across sessions. Agents become more effective the more you use them. Run `/gaia-memory-hygiene` periodically to detect stale or contradicted decisions.

---

## Limitations

- **Single-user only** — GAIA uses markdown files for state management (stories, sprint status, architecture docs). Multiple team members editing the same project will run into file conflicts.
- **Claude Code required** — GAIA is built specifically for Claude Code and cannot run on other AI coding assistants.
- **Context budget** — Complex workflows can consume significant context. The framework enforces a 40K token budget per activation with just-in-time loading to manage this, but very large projects may hit limits.
